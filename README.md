# Piano Bop

![Am I responsive image to go here]()

Piano Bop is a web page that provides the user with a fun game to play. The game takes it's inspiration from the original Simon game but with it's own twist on it, the twist being that it's played through a piano keyboard. When the keys are pressed, they make a sound which represents a note on the piano.

The game is primarily about providing the user with a fun time, but it has other goals. It aims to inspire people to begin playing music, whether that is piano, guitar or any other instrument. Through playing the game, people will hopefully realise that they can easily learn to play a couple of songs which might start them on their journey to learning to play. 

Piano Bop aims to be a really simple game and web-page overall that doesn't take any time or skill to start playing. I hope you enjoy!

### Design Choices
To keep the game nice and simple for the user, I decided to keep the colour scheme nice and basic. The user’s attention should be drawn to the game area as soon as possible with no confusion about what the aim of the game is. To achieve this, the game area is going to be placed in the middle of the screen with a contrasting background colour.

#### Fonts: 
There is very little writing on the landing page so as not to confuse the user and to not take attention away from the game area. For the fonts, I decided to go to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?standard-styles=) which is great for getting any kind of font you want. The fonts I chose for my page are *Roboto* & *Lato* with *sans-serif* as a backup font in the event that Google Fonts does not work. 

#### Colours:
When deciding what colour scheme to choose for my project, I decided to keep it really simple with mainly block colours and little design so as to keep the site looking simple yet sleep and visually appealing.

I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to generate a colour scheme for the site. This is a really cool site that randomly generates colour schemes. You can just keep generating new colour schemes until you find one that fits what your requirements are. When the colour scheme comes up, it provides you with the Hex value of the colours so you can just copy and paste it into your code. See below for my choice of colour scheme. 

![Colour Pallette](assets/images/piano-bop-colours.png)

The HEX values of the colours that I used are: 
* #FBFFF1 - Ivory 
    * I picked this colour for my piano keys as this is what colour they are in real life.

* #3F4045 - Onyx
    * I picked this colour as it is a dark gray colour which matches the theme of the black and white piano.

* #30292F - Black Coffee
    * I picked this colour, again because it is close to black and will work well as the black keys on the piano among other items on the page

* #58A4B0 - Cadet Blue
    * I picked this colour to add an injection of colour into the page and give it an appealing look. This will be used in various items on the page including headers and borders etc

* #FCFCFC - White 
    * I picked white to be in my website colour scheme as it is a simple colour that contrasts well to all other colours and is keeping with the theme of the piano

#### Icons
I used some music icons to add some design to the page and keep with the music theme. I got these from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) which is a great website for all your icon needs. I feel that the icons just add a little bit of extra style to the page and make it overall a bit more visually appealing.
